# Text to Speech Video Sample

This is the sample project from my Text-to-Speech tutorial on YouTube. The included dictionary is from the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department, although I removed a version of "deja" that contained non-ASCII characters which would raise an error (There is a way to properly handle it though). Additionally, not all the speech sounds have been included.
